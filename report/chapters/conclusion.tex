\section{Introduction} \label{c--introduction}

In this chapter, the project is summarised overall. Then some conclusions are drawn about the different parts of the work in section \ref{c--summary} and finally in section \ref{c--future-work} future work is discussed.

\section{Summary} \label{c--summary}

Chapter \ref{l-r} reviews home-brewing and user experience through performance.

Chapter \ref{a-d} describes the design of the proposed solution.

Chapter \ref{s-i} describes the system implementation of the proposed solution and testing.

Chapter \ref{t-e} describes the testing and evaluation.

Chapter \ref{c} is the conclusion with future work.

\section{Conclusions} \label{c--conclusions}

The aim of this project was to create progressive web app. There was a focus on offline technologies as well as performance.

Implemented was a home-brewing system that implemented offline caching using service workers, synced clientside database and modern performance driven development.

In Chapter \ref{i} the aim was to explore the principles and technologies explored in the review. This was achieved through the implementation, seeing what is possible and harder to implement.

\section{Future Work} \label{c--future-work}

Initially the requirements not fulfilled in the implementation would be the first to be considered as future work. Bringing in more complex functionality as seen in other software such as recipe editing, social network features could be explored too.

Moving away from the core concept of this project looking at integration with brewing set-ups and allow for automation would be a great direction to take. Especially looking at projects such as the Physical Web which compliments progressive web apps. \cite{physical_web}

\section{Closing words} \label{c--closing-words}

The web is a place of ever changing challenge. For the forthcoming future, progressive web apps show a great promise to bring more accessibility to people everywhere.
